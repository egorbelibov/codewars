# Statement:
#
# John wants to decorate a room with wallpaper. He's heard that making sure he has
# the right amount of wallpaper is more complex than it sounds. He wants a fool-proof method for
# getting it right.
#
# John knows that the rectangular room has a length of l meters, a width of w meters, a height of h
# meters. The standard width of the rolls he wants to buy is 52 centimeters. The length of a roll
# is 10 meters. He bears in mind however, that itâ€™s best to have an extra length of wallpaper handy
# in case of mistakes or miscalculations so he wants to buy a length 15% greater than the one
# he needs.
#
# Last time he did these calculations he got a headache, so could you help John?
# Your function wallpaper(l, w, h) should return as a plain English word in lower case the number
# of rolls he must buy.
#
# - wallpaper(4.0, 3.5, 3.0) should return "ten"
# - wallpaper(0.0, 3.5, 3.0) should return "zero"
# all rolls (even with incomplete width) are put edge to edge
# - 0 <= l, w, h (floating numbers), it can happens that w x h x l is zero
# - the integer r (number of rolls) will always be less or equal to 20
